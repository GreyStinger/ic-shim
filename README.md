# IceCat Shimming Tool

There are lots of things to still work on, and my compile and run script is not really optimized.

But it does work.

## Tool

You can hot add or remove certain regs and just reload the page to see the changes


## Installation

Just clone this repo

Make sure that you have GNUIceCat installed on your machine

And make sure that the run.sh file is marked as executable with `chmod +x ./run.sh`

## Setup

Rename regs.dat.bkp to regs.dat and edit it to how you would like it

Then all you have to do is run `./run.sh setup` or `make` and then `./run.sh`
